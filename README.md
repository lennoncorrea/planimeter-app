# Planimeter App

This project was designed specifically for a Calculus 3 homework. The app can calculate the area of a closed curve given its points. It uses point interpolation, which may result in less precision than other methods such as the shoelace algorithm. However, the purpose of this app was to simulate a polar planimeter using [Green's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%27s_theorem).

## Usage
To use the application, you need to provide points of a closed curve, such as (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), and (1, 1), in order to get an accurate calculation of the area. Once the curve is closed, the app will provide an approximation of the area.
